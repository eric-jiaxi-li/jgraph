# Catboy's jGRAPH: A simple graphing calculator in Java
### Run "Main.java" to start the program.

#### Entering expressions:
- Expressions are parsed in the form "y =". For example, if you would like to graph the equation y = x + 1, you should type "x + 1" in the input field.
- Add and delete graphed equations using the "+" and "-" buttons next to each input field.
- Press ENTER once you are done typing in an equation. This will update the graph.

#### Configuring the window:
- Adjust the x and y ranges of the graph using the "Settings" menu.
- Zoom in and out with the corresponding buttons.

#### Generating output tables:
- Click the "Table" button next to your expression of interest. You can configure settings in the popup window.
- View the tables in the "tables" folder. If using Eclipse, you will need to first refresh the folder in the Project Explorer.
